# Comp-Neuro-SpikingNN
Google colab tutorial of spiking neural network simulation with spike time dependent plasticity that I created for my final project in computational neuroscience. 
The liquid state machine resevior recieves a spike train that represents encoded audio from from an auditory nerve simulation, and the synaptic weights update
in the LSM with STDP which is similar to the type of plasticity used in the brain. 
In this tutorial I only completed the audio encoder, LSM with STDP simulation, and the visualization of the the networks connectivity before and after exposure to audio stimulus. 
In the future a neural network readout layer can be used to test the quality of the representations in the LSM activity.
